# Project Background

---

The Congressional Medal of Honor is a very important award for a member of the United States Military to receive. There have been over three thousand recipients of the Medal of Honor. With so many recipients, a number of historical questions about the recipients should be desired to be answeres. These questions can include, "Which branch of the U.S. Military contains the most recipients?", "How many recipients are still on this earth?", "Which ranks recieved the most medals?" and other questions. I think that there can be much to learn from the study of these Medal of Honor recipients and their deeds. It is the purpose of this project to answer historical questions about the recipients of the Medal of Honor based on the historical data which is there.

## Historical Background

Put a discussion of any relevant historigraphy you think relates to the topic.You can discuss the historiography of specific times and places, but you can also discuss any theoretical literature you think is relevant.

You have freedom to roam from the narrow topic of your project to explore how different authors/schools of thought have impacted scholarly approaches over time. However, make sure that in the end you clearly relate how this discussion relates to the subject of your project and/or your choices in methods or interpreative models.

As you discuss different authors, you may site them using (author, page) style parenthetical notation. Make sure that a full citation in [Chicago](http://chicagomanualofstyle.org) is added to the 'docs/credits.md' page.
